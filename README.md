# EmailVaildation
here is all the code I have for this program... I can't wrap my brain around fitting it all together.
 for method isAlphanumeric that takes as input char, I want that char to be each char of a string. now I can do this using for loop, however the string email is in the main function. I really feel like I am going around in circles
